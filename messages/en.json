      "q1": {
        "question": "How much does an Arcadian table cost?",
        "answer": "The Standard starts at \u20ac1,920 and The Grand at \u20ac2,390. These are 2026 Q1 batch prices, available until April 30, 2026 or until all 50 batch slots are filled."
      },
      "q2": {
        "question": "What sizes are available?",
        "answer": "We offer two sizes: The Standard (108\u00d7108cm, seats 4) and The Grand (108\u00d7189cm, seats 6-8). Both feature a 10cm deep recessed vault for gaming."
      },
      "q3": {
        "question": "What wood is the table made from?",
        "answer": "Arcadian tables are crafted from solid European oak. We offer two finish options: Arcadian Dawn (natural light oak) and Pan's Shadow (rich walnut tones). A mystery third finish will be revealed exclusively to 2026 batch supporters."
      },
      "q4": {
        "question": "How long does assembly take?",
        "answer": "About 30 minutes. The table arrives flat-packed with pre-drilled holes and requires only a single tool. No guesswork, no leftover screws."
      },
      "q5": {
        "question": "Will it fit through my door?",
        "answer": "Yes. Both sizes are designed to fit through standard doorways when flat-packed. Both The Standard and The Grand fit easily."
      },
      "q6": {
        "question": "What is the recessed vault?",
        "answer": "The vault is a 10cm deep play area beneath the table surface. It keeps game components secure, allows you to leave games set up between sessions, and transforms into a dining table when the toppers are placed on top."
      },
      "q7": {
        "question": "How do the toppers work?",
        "answer": "The toppers are precision-sized solid oak panels that rest on the table frame, covering the vault. They're heavy enough to stay put during meals but light enough for easy one-hand removal when it's game time."
      },
      "q8": {
        "question": "What is the magnetic rail system?",
        "answer": "The rail system runs along the inner perimeter of the vault. Accessories like cup holders, dice trays, and component bins snap into place with industrial-strength magnets\u2014no screws required. Position them anywhere along the rail."
      },
      "q9": {
        "question": "What finish is used on the wood?",
        "answer": "We use a plant-based hardwax oil that's 0% VOC and solvent-free. It penetrates the wood fibers for outstanding resistance to wear, water, and heat while preserving the natural look and feel of the oak."
      },
      "q10": {
        "question": "When will my table ship?",
        "answer": "The 2026 batch is estimated to ship in Q3 2026. We'll provide regular updates to all supporters throughout the production process."
      },
      "q11": {
        "question": "Do you ship internationally?",

      },
      "q12": {
        "question": "What's included with the table?",
        "answer": "Every Arcadian table includes the table frame, legs, topper panels, and assembly hardware. Accessories like cup holders and dice trays are available separately."
      },
      "q13": {
        "question": "How durable is the table?",
        "answer": "Built to last generations. Solid oak construction, traditional joinery techniques, and a protective hardwax finish ensure your table can handle decades of game nights, family dinners, and daily use."
      },
      "q14": {
        "question": "Can I see the table in person?",
